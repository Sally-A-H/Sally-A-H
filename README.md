- 👋 Hi, I’m @Sally-A-H
- 👀 I’m interested in learning full-stack development, making music using loops, and am a 2D animation hobbyist.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Ruby, having learned javaScript, HTML and CSS, and responsive web design. I am also 
     learning how to animate my doodles using adobe Animate and Character Animate. 
- :grinning: Fun fact! I worked as a deck-hand on a fishing boat for about 4 months as a student and learned to sleep standing up!
